 # Badminton String Tension Detector

Here's a simple mobile app I built in React-Native that determines the string tension in a badminton racket based on its frequency, and thickness. It is currently still in progress, but I am planning to deploy it to the Android app store once it is complete.

## Set up process:
- Clone the repository using: "git clone https://github.com/AndrewWang12345/badminton-string-tension.git"
- Install dependencies using: npm install
- Open your Android Studio emulator
- Run the development server: npx expo start
